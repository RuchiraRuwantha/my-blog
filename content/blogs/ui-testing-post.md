In modern web development, ensuring a seamless user experience is crucial. As React applications grow in complexity, manual testing becomes inefficient and error prone. This is where automated UI testing comes in, helping developers catch bugs early and maintain application stability. Cypress has emerged as a popular choice for end-to-end (E2E) testing, offering a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly way to test React applications. Unlike traditional testing frameworks, Cypress runs directly in the browser, providing real-time feedback and powerful debugging tools.
